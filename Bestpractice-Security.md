Securing and following best practices in **Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment)** is critical, especially in production or internet-facing deployments. Here's a comprehensive guide divided into **best practices** and **security recommendations**:

---

## üîß **Best Practices for Proxmox VE**

### 1. **Installation and Base Configuration**

* **Use the latest Proxmox ISO** to benefit from the newest features and fixes.
* **Use ZFS** for storage if you want snapshots, replication, and data integrity (scrubbing, checksumming).
* **Configure a static IP** during installation to avoid DHCP-related disruptions.

### 2. **Storage Management**

* Use **LVM-Thin** for local storage if you want better snapshot and space management.
* Keep **VM disks separate** from ISO/backup repositories.
* Monitor disk I/O and use `iotop`, `zpool iostat`, or `pveperf` to benchmark and diagnose.

### 3. **Backup Strategy**

* Set **automated scheduled backups** using vzdump (daily or weekly depending on criticality).
* Store backups **on separate storage** (NFS, CIFS, or external ZFS).
* Test restore **periodically** to ensure backups are valid.

### 4. **High Availability (HA)**

* Use **Proxmox Cluster + HA Manager** for critical VM workloads.
* Ensure **shared storage** is available if HA is required.
* At least **3 nodes for quorum** in clusters to prevent split-brain.

## üîí **Security Best Practices**

### 1. **Authentication & Access Control**

* **Disable root SSH login**:

  ```bash
  PermitRootLogin no
  ```
* Use **SSH key authentication** instead of passwords.
* Enforce **2FA** on Proxmox web UI (`Datacenter > Permissions > Two-Factor Authentication`).
* Create **non-root user accounts** with appropriate roles using Proxmox ACLs.

### 2. **Firewall Configuration**

* Enable and configure the **Proxmox Firewall** (node level + datacenter level).
* Apply **"drop all except..."** rules for management interfaces.
* Limit access to port **8006 (Proxmox web UI)** using the firewall or reverse proxy.

### 3. **HTTPS & Certificates**

* Replace self-signed SSL certs with **Let's Encrypt** or internal CA certificates.
* Regularly **rotate TLS certificates** and disable older TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0, 1.1).

### 4. **System Hardening**

* Keep **Proxmox and all packages up to date**:

  ```bash
  apt update && apt full-upgrade
  ```
* Disable unused services (e.g., NFS, CIFS, Avahi if not in use).
* Configure **AppArmor** or **SELinux** where possible.
* Consider **auditing** with tools like `auditd`.

### 5. **Network Isolation**

* Isolate VM traffic from management traffic using **VLANs** or **separate bridges**.
* Do not expose the management interface to the public internet.
* Use **VPN access** (e.g., WireGuard or OpenVPN) for remote administration.

### 6. **Logging and Monitoring**

* Use **remote syslog** or **ELK stack** for centralized logging.
* Monitor via **Prometheus + Grafana**, or use Proxmox‚Äôs built-in metrics server.
* Set up **alerts** for high load, failed backups, disk space issues, etc.

### 7. **Updates and Patch Management**

* Regularly **update the kernel** and reboot for security patches.
* Subscribe to the **Proxmox Enterprise Repository** for stable updates (recommended for production).

## üîÅ Optional: Advanced Hardening

* Use **fail2ban** with custom filters for Proxmox web UI and SSH.
* Restrict `sudo` access with tight controls and logging.
* Implement **IP-based rate limiting** via reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX in front of the web GUI).
